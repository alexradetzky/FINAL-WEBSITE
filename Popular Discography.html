      Though Phish by many are said to have   poor lyrics (Great, by others), it's albums like Junta that show that   all they wanted to do is jam and have fun. And when you think about it,   that is basically what Jam Bands are about. Like &quot;Were going to do our   thing, and if you enjoy it, great&quot; and that is why Jam Bands usually do   not hit the mainstream, and are cult groups. JOON - ta, not HUNTA - ta,   (Named after a good friend) was not Phish's first official release.   Their first, entitled <em>The White Tapes</em> or oddly enough <em>The White Album</em> was never released to the public through a record company. So, in a way, <em>Junta</em> is Phish's first album. <br />
      <br />
      <em>Junta</em> is strongly based on jamming, definatley more so than any   other Phish album. The album also gives off a very real sound, similar   to how a bands first album usually is. Mainly because at this time,   their were simply a couple of Vermont dorm room pals who just liked to   jam. Money really wasn't a must, cathing fame (Especially from a Jam   Band) were very unrealilistic. But luckily Phish managed to break into   the mainstream and put a scar into it, unlike anyone has really done   before.<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></strong></p>
